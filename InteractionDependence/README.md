# Interaction Dependence of the 1-Particle Entanglement Entropy

The effective interaction dependence of the 1-particle partition
second Renyi entanglement entropy $S_2(n=1)-\ln(N)$.  Open (closed)
points were computed via exact diagonalization of the t-V model for N=13
with repulsive (attractive) interactions.  The lines show the prediction from
the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory for three different values of the
ultraviolet cutoff Δ measured in units of the density ρ0.
