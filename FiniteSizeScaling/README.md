Finite size scaling of $S_2(n=1)-\ln(N)$ with $N^{-(4g+1)}$
for <math>2 \leq N \leq 14</math> confirming the empirical asymptotic scaling predicted by
Zozulya \emph{et al.} \cite{Zozulya:2007jw} and identifying the power of the
leading finite size correction as $\gamma = 4g + 1$.  The coefficients $a$ and
$b$ depend on the interaction strength $V/t$ and are calculated from a linear
fit of the exact diagonalization data according to Eq. (10).
