Interaction effects on the n-particle entanglement entropy
Sα(n) for α = 1,2 in the ground state of the t-V model. (a)
Sα(n=1)-ln N vs V/t for N = 13 and 14 with periodic and
anti-periodic boundary conditions respectively. The light gray vertical lines
mark the location of the known phases transitions at V/t = ± 2. The
subtracted ln (N) term is the one-particle entanglement
entropy for free fermions.  Inset: the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid
region where we expect the continuum theory to apply. (b)
Sα(n=N/2)- ln \binom{N}{N/2} vs
V/t for macroscpic partitions with 1 ≤ n ≤ 5  and anti-periodic
boundary conditions. As n → N/2 features appear near the phase transitions
for α = 1.
